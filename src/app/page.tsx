      explanation: "Great product teams focus on the problem space before exploring the solution space. A well-defined problem specifies who is facing it, what the friction is, and what outcome they are looking to achieve, without proposing any technology or interface. Working in the problem space keeps your team aligned on user needs rather than getting emotionally attached to specific features.",
      example: "Zoom didn't win by adding hundreds of features. They focused on one core problem space: 'It's too hard to join a video call, and the video lags.' By fixing connection reliability and creating one-click link joining, they solved the primary friction point."

    concept: {
      explanation: "Knowing your users isn't about looking at demographics (e.g., '25-34 year olds in city centers'). It is about understanding their behaviors, goals, and struggles. Continuous customer interviewing—talking to a customer every single week—is the best way to uncover active struggles. When interviewing, avoid asking hypothetical future questions (e.g., 'Would you use this feature?'). Instead, ask about concrete past behavior.",
      example: "Slack's early development involved interviewing and observing diverse teams (non-tech teams, designers, writers) who had zero experience with IRC. They watched users get stuck on setup steps and customized their onboarding to ensure ease of use."

Desirability: Do users want this? Do they care?\n2. Viability: Should we build this? Does it fit our business model?\n3. Feasibility: Can we build this with our tech stack and timeline?\n4. Usability: Can users figure out how to use it?\nMapping these assumptions allows us to test the riskiest assumptions first.",
      example: "When Airbnb launched, their biggest desirability assumption was: 'Travelers are willing to stay in a stranger's spare bedroom.' Their biggest usability/safety assumption was: 'Hosts are comfortable letting strangers sleep in their homes.'"

Common methods include:\n- Landing Page Test: Create a webpage describing the service and measure signups.\n- Wizard of Oz: The front-end looks automated, but the back-end is entirely manual human labor.\n- Concierge: Deliver the service to the customer manually and face-to-face.",
      example: "Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn tested the assumption 'people are willing to buy shoes online' by photographing shoes in local stores, posting them on a website, and manually buying and shipping them when order emails arrived. He built zero inventory systems."

      explanation: "The Opportunity-Solution Tree (OST), popularized by Teresa Torres, is a visual map that helps product teams maintain alignment. It starts with a clear Business Outcome (e.g. increase customer retention). Below that sit User Opportunities (needs, pain points, desires). Below opportunities are Solutions, and below solutions are Assumption Tests. This ensures every feature you build connects directly to a user need and a business goal.",
      example: "If Netflix's outcome is 'Increase monthly subscription renewal', an opportunity might be 'I want to watch movies with my friends remotely.' A solution is 'Group Watch party mode', and assumption tests check if users can sync video streams."

      question: "What is the primary benefit of mapping multiple solutions under a single Opportunity in an OST?",
      options: [
        "It speeds up database queries.",
        "It prevents the team from falling in love with a single solution, encouraging them to compare options.",
        "It eliminates the need to do user interviews.",
        "It helps engineers write clean code."
      ],

A popular framework is RICE:\n- Reach: How many users will this affect in a given timeframe?\n- Impact: How much will this contribute to our target outcome? (3=Massive, 2=High, 1=Medium, 0.5=Low)\n- Confidence: How sure are we about these estimates? (100%=High, 80%=Medium, 50%=Low)\n- Effort: How many person-months will it take?\nRICE Score = (Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort.",
      example: "Intercom used RICE to evaluate a user notification feature. They estimated huge reach, medium impact, and 80% confidence, but 5 months of effort. They compared it to a login reminder (lower reach, high confidence, 0.5 months of effort) which scored much higher."
    },

    quiz: {
      question: "Under the RICE framework, what happens to a feature's score if the Effort increases while all other variables remain constant?",
      options: [

It has three parts: it measures customer value, represents product strategy, and is a leading indicator of revenue. We break the North Star into actionable Input Metrics (e.g. daily uploads, user search time) which teams can influence directly, avoiding a focus on lagging metrics like Revenue or Monthly Active Users.",
